"Media queries only affect the styling once the markup and other resources have reached the browser"
  - (this point is less important these days with the propagation of 4G (and soon to be 5G), but the reality is that media queries do not defer resource loads
  
"Media queries are not supported by most of the world's web browsers"
  - (this point is nill in 2019, feels super dated)
  
Context of mobile matters - e.g. the user's context differs between mobile and desktop use (sometimes, I mean, peoplet typically browse their phones on the couch or sitting around these days, ref: Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug)

Context of activity on the website matters e.g. what is a user likely to be browsing on mobile for? usually truncated information

"media queries are not the silver bullet for the mobile context"

"Today’s ‘Responsive Web Design’ is a lukewarm response to a similar seismic shift – that of the sedentary web into expectant mobile hands."
