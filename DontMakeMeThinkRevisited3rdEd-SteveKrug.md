- Do usability testing (duh!)
- Complex heuristics (no hard and fast rules)

#CH1
- Design for LCD!
- "There's almost always a plausible rationale - and good, if misguided intention, behind every usability flaw"
- 'Obvious clickability'

- Exceptions: "You can't make everything self-evident" - but try "self-explanatory"

#CH2
- Users "Glance", "Scan", "Click"
- "Most web use involves trying to get something done, and usually done quickly"
- Krug postulates "Free", "Sale", "Sex" and our name as "hardwired trigger words" (haha, perhaps)
- We don't choose the best option, we choose the first reasonable option, "satisficing" (I'm okay with this philosophy, time is limited)
- "We don't figure out how things work, we muddle through"
- "A lot of people think Google is the internet"
- Website should make user "feel smart"
- "Design great billboards"
