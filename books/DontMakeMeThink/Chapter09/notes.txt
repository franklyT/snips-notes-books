never test too late (good for software development as well)

(http://someslightlyirregular.com/blog/2011/08/12/you-say-potato/) - Steve's focus group vs usability testing video

focus group - talking about opinions and feelings about things
usability test - watching a person try to use something

"focus groups are best used in the planning stages of the product" "are you building he right product?"
Steve feels that usability tests should be used throughout the entire process

testing is like "havings friends visit from out of town" - you see things you don't notice because you're so used to them

a one user test is "100% better" than a 0 user test
"testing one user early in the project is better than testing 50 near the end" (again, feels markety)

users don't like change!

Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems by Steve Krug

"one morning a month" testing - "I think every web development team should spend one morning a month doing usability testing"

agile development = testing more frequently

DIY usability testing = three participants

"you can find more problems in half a day than you can fix in a month" - Krug believes three users are likely to encounter major problems

"recruit loosely and grade on a curve" - "would our users have that problem, or was it a problem becase they didn't know what our users know?"

"not good to design a site so that only your target audience can use it"

experts appreciate "clarity" - not something "dumbed down"

How to Recruit Participants for Usability Strudies by the Nielsen Norman Group

facilitator - encourage user to think out loud

"debriefing" - top three usability problems

usability testing competitive sites to know what to do and not do

"if you're redesigning an existing site, you'll also want to test it before you start, so you'll know what's not working (and needs to be changed) and what is working (so you don't break it)"

create list of tasks to do - word tasks carefully

allow participants to choose some details of the task

Krug's script for testing websites - rocketsurgerymadeeasy.com

if they ask for help, say "what would you do if I weren't here?"

common problems with usability

"users are unclear on the concept"

"the words they're looking for aren't there"

"there's too much going on"

"FOCUS RUTHLESSLY ON FIXING THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEMS FIRST" - don't put them off or focus on smaller problems
  - make a collective list (tallies?)
  - choose the ten most serious problems
  - rate them
  - create an ordered list (how will these issues be fixed? who will fix them?) - a tweak will often take it out of the category of "serious problem"
  - separate list of "low-hanging fruit" (not serious problems, but easy to fix)
  - taking away is usually better than adding
  - "take new feature requests with a grain of salt"
  - ignore "kayak" problems (user will right themselves more or less easily)

top five plausible reasons for not testing websites
  - "we don't have the time" (make testing "as simple as possible")
  - "we don't have the money" (doesn't have to be expensive)
  - "we don't have the expertise" (it's easy to do)
  - "we don't have a usability lab" (you don't need one, room with a desk, computer and two chairs)
  - "we wouldn't know how to interpret the results" (it's obvious)
