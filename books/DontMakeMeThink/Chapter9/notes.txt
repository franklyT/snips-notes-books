never test too late (good for software development as well)

(http://someslightlyirregular.com/blog/2011/08/12/you-say-potato/) - Steve's focus group vs usability testing video

focus group - talking about opinions and feelings about things
usability test - watching a person try to use something

"focus groups are best used in the planning stages of the product" "are you building he right product?"
Steve feels that usability tests should be used throughout the entire process

testing is like "havings friends visit from out of town" - you see things you don't notice because you're so used to them

a one user test is "100% better" than a 0 user test
"testing one user early in the project is better than testing 50 near the end" (again, feels markety)

users don't like change!

"one morning a month" testing - "I think every web development team should spend one morning a month doing usability testing"

agile development = testing more frequently
