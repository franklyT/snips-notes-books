krug describes the introduction of the iphone in 2007 (was it that long ago?) as "the great leap forward"

"it's all about tradeoffs"

"constraints actually make design easier and foster innovation" (e.g. poetry forms, I think it's an obvious assertion)

mobile first constraint - user will keep tapping or scrolling if they feel that they're going to find the information they need

"managing real estate challenges shouldn't be done at the cost of usability" - Manikandan Baluchamy

two separate versions of things will lack parity and require more work - but if so, "always provide a link to the 'full' website"

affordances - visual clues in an object's design that suggest how we can use it - The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman

death of the hover (via mobile)

"flat design" - heavy minimalistic trend - if you use flat design, use remaining dimensions to compensate for what you lose

(I feel like Krug's talk here about speed misses the mark a bit, 4G has really good saturation now... and we're moving into a 5G world. but, yeah, optimization.)

Krug's definition of usability: "A person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing [i.e., it's learnable] to accomplish something [effective] without it being more trouble than it's worth [efficient]."

"useful" / "desireable" marketing questions, not design questions, Krug feels

"delightful" (not so sure about this)

"learnable"

"memorability" (relarning is easy if it is easy to learn in the first place)
  - "life is cheap (99 cents) on mobile devices"

(this whole camera diversion seems a bit dated. you could just use scrcpy, turn on tap marks, and hook the user up via USB to a screen capped PC. I'm okay with this and feel the wire is more liberating than the camera, but wireless screen transfers to PC also exist)
