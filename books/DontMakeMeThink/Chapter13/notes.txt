'Steve Jobs sold UX'

proselytize usability commonly:
  - demonstrate ROI - Cost-justifying Usability: An Update for the Interner Age by Randolph Bias and Deborah Mayhew
  - speak marketing language
  
the Steve Krug way(tm):
  - get your boss (and her boss) to watch a usability test - executives find this interesting (or make a short video for people to watch)
  - do the first one on your own time (pick an easy target)
  - test the competition
  - understand the management point of view
  - "know your place" (Steve cautions us not to take it personally)

  Steve's wonderlist:
    - don't use small, low-contrast type
    - don't put labels inside form fields (read don't put labels inside text bosses (unless you're luke w)")
    - preserve the distinction between visited and unvisted text links
    - don't float headings between two paragraphs (make them closer to the text that follows than the text that precedes)
