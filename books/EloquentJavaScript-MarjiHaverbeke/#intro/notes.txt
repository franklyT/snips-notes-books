Second read of Eloquent JavaScript, working (hopefully fruitfully) through the exercises along the way.

"Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming."

"A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk about the actions that the computer has to perform on a higher level." (And yet Haverbeke's repos contain one C++ program and no Python programs!, he probably considers it less relatively than I am)

"There are those who will say terrible things about JavaScript. Many of these things are true." (Lol.)

"JavaScriptâ€™s ascent to dominance... roughly between 2000 and 2010."
