home page:
  - site identity (brand) and mission
  - site hierarchy
  - search 
  - "teases"
  - content promos (newest, best, most popular)
  - feature promos (explore more)
  - timely content (frequent updates)
  - deals (allocated for advertising, cross-promotion, and co-branding)
  - shortcuts (most frequently used content)
  - registration (as needed, "welcome back, x")

home page should show you what you're looking for (make it obvious, simple, stupid)
AND what you're not looking for (check out this new content)

show you where to start (no idea where to begin? you blew it!)

establish credibility and trust (abstract, but general professionalism and slick appearances)

"one size fits all" (is this possible?)

home page answers, "what is this?", "what do they have here?", "what can I do here?", "why should I be here and not somewhere else?"

"big baby theory of web design, first few seconds you spend on a web site or web page are critical"
ref: Attention Web Designers: You Have 50 Milliseconds to Make A Good First Impression!"

"if they are lost when they start out, they usually just keep getting...loster"

the greatness of your website is not obvious

don't have hubris about who "gets" your site

portal to website page > back to home page for bearings

Home Page Blocks:
  - the tagline - space right next to site ID - phrase is a tagline/description of whole site
  - welcome blurb (isn't this too "happy talky" that Krug advises against? maybe not.)
  - the learn more - short explanatory video

"what is kickstarter" example - most prominent item in primary navigation

"don't use a mission statement as a welcome blurb" (okay, Krug clarifies here. this is happy talk.)

"don't trust your judgment, show home page to people from outside your organization"

"nothing beats a good tagline"
