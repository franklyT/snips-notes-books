"Omit needless words" - E.B. White's The Elements of Style

"When I look at web pages, I'm struck by the fact that most of the words I see are just taking up space, because 
no one is ever going to read them" - but they suggest that you must read them just by being on the page

"Remove half of the words"

"happy talk must die" - eliminate "small talk"

"nobody is going to read instructions" - at least until they've failed for awhile - "make everything self-explanatory"
