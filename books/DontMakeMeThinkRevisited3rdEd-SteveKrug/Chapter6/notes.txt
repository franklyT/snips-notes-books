People are usually trying to "find something" on a website

web equivalent of "asking directions" is using a search box

Jacob Nielsen - "Search dominant users" vs. "link dominant users"

web space:
- "no sense of scale" (useful for clicked links to be different color)
- "no sense of direction"
- "no sense of location"

"web navigation" - "figuring out where you are"

persistent navigation - "site ID, sections, utilities, search"

forms don't require the consistency of navigation, which might be distracting

home button in sight at all times

search bar is quite important

every page needs a name

"you are here" highlighting of current location in navigation bars, lists, or menus

don't be too subtle with that visual indicator - add more than one

"breadcrumbs" subitem A > subitem B > subitem C > item d (you are here)

Steve likes tabs

"the trunk test"

- choose a page on a site at random, print it
- hold it at arms length or squint
- as quickly as possible, try to find the following items:
  - site id
  - page name
  - sections (primary navigation)
  - local navigation
  - "you are here" indicators
  - search
